How did it become a symbol of ritual with the Yorubas and why do we celebrate or idolize the North Star?<br><br>The first writing about the North Star was in the story of Jesus' birth in Nazareth and the appearance of the &quot;three wise men&quot; guided in by the North Star. <br><br>The three wise men were priests and worshippers of Celestial Illumination, primarily, North Star.  <br><br>The interpretation of their presence in Nazareth is that they observed a change in the Star and divined to find meaning. Divination revealed that a king is born.  They appeased through divination and offerings for the Star to guide them to the king. This is how they ended up in the manger where Jesus was born.  <br><br>This would show that a spirituality of deity worshipping and celestial cults existed in Palestine and Jerusalem in the midst of Judaism and ahead of Christianity and Islam.  <br><br>Who were those that practiced this spirituality?</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt55417248">1 Like </b> <b id='shb55417248'></b><tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="55418058"></a><a name="msg55418058"></a><a name="3729917.7"></a><a href="/3729917/where-how-north-got-political#55418058">Re: Where And How North Got Its Political Logo.</a> by <a href="/metaphysical"  class=user>MetaPhysical</a>: <span class=s><b>7:19pm</b> On <b>Apr 09</b>, <b>2017</b> </span><tr><td id="pb55418058" class="l w pd"><div class=narrow>The first picture is the symbol in its primal state, used by the cult.<br><br>The second is a multiple, used for styling. <br><br>The third is the Christian version, the knot is super-imposed on the cardinal cross.  <br><br><br>The third one is the version adopted by Ahmadu Bello for use as political symbol for Northern Region.  I know the word cross or christian symbol might make the Hausa/Fulani uncomfortable but I want to share that the cross itself predated Christianity.  Christians did not invent the cross, they adopted it.  The Cross as an object can be classified as a symbol of universal application.  It belongs to no one and can be used by everyone, Muslims included!   In fact, a part of the Staff of Authority used in the Sultanate and Emirates has a cross on it, and is not in recognition of Christianity.</div><p class=s> <b id="lpt55418058">  </b> <b id='shb55418058'></b><p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/5130557_screenshot20170408025812_png870f4dc5014e2c83733676fd74f5486c"> <p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/5130558_download_pngc26be60cfd1ba40772b5ac48b95ab19b"> <p><img class="attachmentimage img" src="https://www.nairaland.com/attachments/5130559_download_jpeg9e044ea0ed5817381b189680f392bafe"> <tr><td class="bold l pu"><a name="55418382"></a><a name="msg55418382"></a><a name="3729917.8"></a><a href="/3729917/where-how-north-got-political#55418382">Re: Where And How North Got Its Political Logo.</a> by <a href="/metaphysical"  class=user>MetaPhysical</a>: <span class=s><b>7:31pm</b> On <b>Apr 09</b>, <b>2017</b> </span><tr><td id="pb55418382" class="l w pd"><div class=narrow>Leo Frobenius, the famous German Anthropologist who entered Africa from Carthage (Libya), crossed the desert and explored the sub-Saharan cultures and history had a lot to say and share about the Yorubas.  <br><br>Among the many items he found historically significant and worth preserving are items of clothing containing &quot;Solomon's Knot&quot;.  <br><br>Why is it called Solomon's knot?

Various ethnicities came into hausaland during the great starvation of the sahel as foreigners. Then bagauda amd his people met barbushe and his people as a foreigner. Rumfa became leader of hausaland as a foreigner. These patterns are similar to the immigration of fulas, their case is differs a tad bit due to the fact that they had an established culture and their migration is quite recent. Looking at history over time, hausa people have always been an assimilation of foreigners. Today distinction between these ethnicities in terms of identity is minimal, just like i am sure distinctions between these groups i mentioned arrived as foreigners has vanished.

When Islam started making inroads into Hausa land in the 14th century, certain aspects of the religion such as idol worship were driven underground. The cult of Tsumbubura in the then Sultanate of Kano and many other similar Bori cults were suppressed, but Bori survived in &quot;spirit-possession&quot; cults by integrating some aspects of Islam. The Bori spirit possession priestesses maintained nominal influence over the Sultanates that replaced the earlier Animist kingdoms.<br><br><br>I hope you understand the basis in which UTHMAN DAN FODIO did suppress the local religion when he came and woo people to support and the usurping he did in Sokoto.
