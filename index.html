        Our organization originated from Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria through the vision of like-minded persons who believes that the right of franchise of the people must be represented and upheld among other Fundamental Human Rights (FHR) and holds the conviction that this body can enhance human dignity and development while encouraging people to assert their rights and vote for justice, fair-play and equity in their activities.
